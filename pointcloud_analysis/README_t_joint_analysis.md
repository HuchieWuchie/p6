# t_joint_analysis

Before running the Code
1. makes sure to set the correct path in line 2. It should be for the include file inside pointcloud_analysis
2. Set the FILE_NAME to the correct file you want to analyze
3. If you want to visualize the pointcloud you should uncomment the line around 68
4. To visualize every line of the point cloud with the gradient and curvature uncomment the lines around 160-175
5. make sure to set the right path for the trajectories to be output around line 180

When running the Code
1. when you run the Code you will be prompted to write an angle for the indentation angle
2. Only write the number and then press enter
3. if the plot function are uncommented you will iterate through each line of the pointcloud by pressing 'q' or by closing the window.
4. First when all the lines have been iterated through will the trajectories are created.
